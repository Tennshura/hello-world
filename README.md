# hello-world
My first foray into the world of Git (utilizing github's hello-world guide)

Dylan here! I comitted (no pun intended) to teaching myself to code, primarily in python, about 2 months ago. I started by reading some books and familiarizing
myself with the syntax and language of python. I'd like to say that I was already pretty well versed in problem solving, but now I'm throwing myself into a facet of it that I have no experience with.
